## Github Pages - Jekyll theme
- [x] Managed to customize Jekyll permalinks for custom collections
- [ ] Made theme more modular
	- [ ] \_layouts > for each file in this folder, add sections from \_includes
	- [ ] clean \_includes : head, footer. Make it minimal. 
> [!question] 
> Should i keep it as simple as possible (few files) or modular?
